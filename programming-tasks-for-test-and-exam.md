## Exercises aimed to prepare for programming test and exam
> Write  every solution in a single file called with the number of exercise and your surname, e.g. `exercise2_zacniewski.py`  
> After test and exam everybody will be asked some questions related to the given exercise and requested to do some little modifications of the programs !!!

#### Exercise 1
Write a program named that prompts the user for input with the string "Tell me your password:".  
The program should then determine the first letter of the user’s input, convert that letter to uppercase, and display it back.
For example, if the user input is "no", then the program should display
the following output:
>The first letter you entered was: N

<br>

#### Exercise 2
Create a string containing an integer, then convert that string into
an actual integer object using `int()`. Test that your new object is
a number by multiplying it by another number and displaying the
result.

<br>

#### Exercise 3
Print the result of fraction calculation (for example `2 / 10`) as a percentage with no decimal places.
The output should look like `20%` in the aforementioned case.


<br>

#### Exercise 4
Create a string object and an integer object, then display them side
by side with a single print function call using `str()`.

<br>

#### Exercise 5
Write a program that uses `input()` twice to get two numbers from
the user, multiplies the numbers together, and displays the result.
If the user enters 2 and 4, then your program should print the
following text:
> The product of 2 and 4 is 8.0.

<br>

#### Exercise 6
Write a program that asks the user for some input
with the following prompt: `Enter some text:`
Use `.replace()` to convert the text entered by the user into leetspeak
by making the following changes to lowercase letters:  
  - The letter a becomes 4
  - The letter b becomes 8
  - The letter e becomes 3
  - The letter l becomes 1
  - The letter o becomes 0
  - The letter s becomes 5
  - The letter t becomes 7
Your program should then display the resulting string as output. Below is a sample run of the program:
>Enter some text: I like to eat eggs and spam.  
>I 1ik3 70 347 3gg5 4nd 5p4m.  
 
<br>

#### Exercise 7

Write a program called exponent.py that receives two numbers from the
user and displays the first number raised to the power of the second
number.
Here’s sample run of what the program should look like, including
example input from the user:  
> Enter a base: 1.2  
> Enter an exponent: 3  
> 1.2 to the power of 3 = 1.7279999999999998

<br>

#### Exercise 8
Write a program that asks the user to input a number and then
displays that number rounded to two decimal places. When run,
your program should look like this:
>Enter a number: 5.432  
>5.432 rounded to 2 decimal places is 5.43  

<br>

#### Exercise 9
Write a program that asks the user to input a number and then
displays the absolute value of that number. When run, your
program should look like this:  
> Enter a number: -10  
> The absolute value of -10 is 10.0

<br>

#### Exercise 10
Write a program that asks the user to input two numbers by using
`input()` twice, then displays whether the difference between those
two numbers is an integer. When run, your program should look
like this:  
> Enter a number: 1.5  
>  Enter another number: .5  
> The difference between 1.5 and .5 is an integer? True!  

If user inputs two numbers whose difference is not integral,
then the output should look like this:  
> Enter a number: 1.5  
> Enter another number: 1.0  
> The difference between 1.5 and 1.0 is an integer? False! 

<br>

#### Exercise 11
Write a function called `cube()` that takes one number parameter
and returns the value of that number raised to the third power.
Test the function by calling your `cube()` function on a few different
numbers and displaying the results.
