## 2. Computer graphics

1. All materials are stored in the `ComputerGraphics` directory.  You can download them and use locally on your machine.  
2. The topics are mostly based on the syllabus to the "Computer Graphics" subject (see the attached pdf file).  
3. There are files for every day of he course in the directory with the given number of the day.  
4. Days 1-5 are mainly lectures. There are `pdf` and `ppt` files for every day and some additional resources.  
5. Days 6-10 are mainly exercises. There are Python scripts to get more practical experience and approach with Image Processing and Computer Graphics.
